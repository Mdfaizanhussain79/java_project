StudentManagement

A simple console-based *Student Management System* written in Java, which performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data using *OOP concepts* and *ArrayList*.

Features

- Add a new student (ID, Name, Marks)
- View all student records
- Update a student by ID
- Delete a student by ID
- Menu-driven user interaction via console

| ArrayList   | Storing multiple Student objects |
| Scanner     | Getting user input               |


##Idea Behind The Project

As a 3rd-year CSE student, I wanted to practice *real-world use of data structures*, instead of just theory. So I chose to build a CRUD-based project using ArrayList to handle objects dynamically like a mini database.

The program shows how Java’s *Object-Oriented Programming* combines with the *Collection Framework* to manage data in a simple system, practicing addition, removal, searching, and updating of data.

#Future Improvements

- Store & retrieve data from a file or database (JDBC)
- Replace ArrayList with HashMap for faster search by ID
- Add exception handling & input validation
- Build a GUI using Swing or JavaFX
